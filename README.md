# Airport

The best way to build a game engine, is to build a game first.

This game utilizes the [Box Game Engine](https://github.com/Ratstail91/Box) the [Toy Programming Language](https://toylang.com).

# Cloning

Either clone recursively, or run `git submodule update --init` after cloning.

# Building

For Windows(mingw32 & cygwin), Linux and MacOS, simply run `make` in the root directory.

For Windows(MSVC), Visual Studio project files are included.

Note: MacOS and Windows(MSVC) are not officially supported, but we'll do our best!

# Running

Make sure the program can see the `assets` folder (symbolic links can help), and all of the required DLLs are present.

# Dependencies

* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_mixer
* SDL2_ttf
* libcurses (for debugging only)
