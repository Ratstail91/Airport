The best way to build a game engine, is to build a game first.

This project has now been adapted into a roguelike for the 7 day roguelike jam.

This game/engine utilizes the [Toy programming langauge](https://toylang.com).

## Cloning

Either clone recursively, or run `git submodule update --init` after cloning.

## Building

We're now using Visual Studio - define the following environment variables to point to the root of each SDL2 lib:

* `SDL2Dir`
* `SDL2ImageDir`
* `SDL2TTFDir`

## Running

Make sure the program can see the `assets` folder (symbolic links can help), and all of the required DLLs are present.

## Dependencies

* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_ttf
